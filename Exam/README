Prerequisites:
-User is created in IAM AWS and configured in the machine where bash/ansible will run
-ansible 2.9.6
-boto 2.49.0 / boto3 1.17.13
-python 3.8.5

Tested with:
-Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS
-ansible 2.9.6
-boto 2.49.0 / boto3 1.17.13
-python 3.8.5
-bash: GNU bash, version 5.0.17
-ssh/ssh-keygen: OpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.1, OpenSSL 1.1.1f

Assumption:
Creation and deletion will be called only once (create first, then delete)

Limitation:
If create is called more than once, delete will fail to delete all resources //had no time to improve this
